# burger_app
Burger App uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Node.js. It uses mysql, express, express-handlebars, and dotenv node packages as well as the model view controller (mvc) folder structure. It is deployed to Heroku and uses JAWSDB to connect to mysql. You can add a new burger , which is then put in the uneaten column, and when you click the devour button the burger is "eaten", and moves to the eaten column. This is done by changing the boolean value from false to true when the burger is eaten.
